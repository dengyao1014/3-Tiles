                <h2>Understanding the Physics</h2>
                <p>The key to achieving incredible distances in Golf Orbit lies in understanding the game's physics engine. The trajectory of your golf ball is affected by three main factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initial power and angle</li>
                    <li>Wind conditions</li>
                    <li>Object interactions</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Perfect Power Control</h2>
                <p>Mastering power control is crucial for consistent performance. Here's how to achieve perfect power shots:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wait for the power meter to reach 95-100%</li>
                    <li>Release precisely when the marker aligns with the sweet spot</li>
                    <li>Practice the timing in training mode until it becomes muscle memory</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Advanced Bounce Techniques</h2>
                <p>Pro players use these advanced bounce techniques to maximize distance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Double Bounce" technique on floating platforms</li>
                    <li>Using angle modifiers for optimal trajectories</li>
                    <li>Combining power-ups with strategic bounces</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Equipment Optimization</h2>
                <p>Your choice of equipment significantly impacts performance. We recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Stellar Driver for maximum initial distance</li>
                    <li>The Bounce Pro attachment for improved bounce physics</li>
                    <li>The Wind Master upgrade for better control in varying conditions</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Pro Tips and Tricks</h2>
                <p>Here are some lesser-known techniques used by top players:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using the "late release" technique for extra power</li>
                    <li>Maximizing altitude for longer flight times</li>
                    <li>Utilizing environmental objects for distance multipliers</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="pro-tip-box">
                    <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
                    <p>Always aim to hit power-up orbs early in your flight path. This maximizes their effect duration and can lead to significantly longer distances.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Practice Routine</h2>
                <p>Implement this daily practice routine to improve consistently:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>15 minutes of power control practice</li>
                    <li>10 attempts at specific bounce techniques</li>
                    <li>5 full-distance attempts implementing all strategies</li>
                </ol>
